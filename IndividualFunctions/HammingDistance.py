'''
We say that position i in k-mers p1 … pk and q1 … qk is a mismatch if pi ≠ qi. For example, CGAAT and CGGAC have two mismatches.
The number of mismatches between strings p and q is called the Hamming distance between these strings and is denoted
HammingDistance(p, q).

Hamming Distance Problem: Compute the Hamming distance between two strings.
     Input: Two strings of equal length.
     Output: The Hamming distance between these strings.

def HammingDistance(p, q):
    if len(p) != len(q):
        return 'Invalid input'

    hamming_dist = 0 # Initialize to zero

    for i in range(len(p)):
        if p[i] != q[i]:
            hamming_dist += 1
    print(hamming_dist)
    #return hamming_dist
